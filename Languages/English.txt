ShowInfoText											= In order to display graphical user interface (GUI) of the application just press shortcut: Win + Ctrl + H. `n`nSuggested steps after installation: `n`n1. Download some libraries (files containing (triggerstring, hotstring) definitions. You can do it from application menu:  → Libraries. `n`n2. After downloading of libraries restart application to apply the changes. Again, you can do it from application menu: Application → Restart. `n`n3. Application is preconfigured on the first start. Options available to be configured area available from GUI, application menu → Configuration. `n`n4. Application runs by default in default mode. If you don't wish to modify configuration, `nmay consider to run it in simplified mode: application menu → Application → Reload → Reload in silent mode.
F_TI_ImmediateExecute									= * (asterisk): An EndChar (e.g. Space, ., or Enter) is not required to trigger the hotstring. For example:`n`n:*:j@::jsmith@somedomain.com`n`nThe example above would send its replacement the moment you type the @ character.
F_TI_InsideWord										= ? (question mark): The hotstring will be triggered even when it is inside another word; `n`nthat is, when the character typed immediately before it is alphanumeric. `nFor example, if :?:al::airline is a hotstring, `ntyping "practical " would produce "practicairline ".
F_TI_NoBackSpace										= B0: Automatic backspacing is not done to erase the abbreviation you type. `n`nOne may send ← five times via {left 5}. For example, the following hotstring produces "<em></em>" and `nmoves the caret 5 places to the left (so that it's between the tags) `n`n::*b0:<em>::</em>{left 5}
F_TI_NoEndChar											= O: Omit the ending character of auto-replace hotstrings when the replacement is produced. `n`nThis is useful when you want a hotstring to be kept unambiguous by still requiring an ending character, `nbut don't actually want the ending character to be shown on the screen. `nFor example, if :o:ar::aristocrat is a hotstring, typing "ar" followed by the spacebar will produce "aristocrat" with no trailing space, `nwhich allows you to make the word plural or possessive without having to press Backspace.
F_TI_OptionResetRecognizer								= Z: Resets the hotstring recognizer after each triggering of the hotstring. `n`nIn other words, the script will begin waiting for an entirely new hotstring, eliminating from consideration anything you previously typed. `nThis can prevent unwanted triggerings of hotstrings.
F_TI_CaseConforming										= By default (if option Case-Sensitive (C) or Not-Case-Sensitive (C1) aren't set) `ncase-conforming hotstrings produce their replacement text in all caps `nif you type the triggerstring in all caps. `n`nIf you type the first letter in caps, `nthe first letter of the replacement will also be capitalized (if it is a letter). `n`nIf you type the case in any other way, the replacement is sent exactly as defined.
F_TI_CaseSensitive										= C: Case sensitive: `n`nWhen you type a triggerstring, `nit must exactly match the case defined.
F_TI_NotCaseConforming									= C1: Do not conform to typed case. `n`nUse this option to make hotstrings case insensitive `nand prevent them from conforming to the case of the characters you actually type.
F_TI_EnterTriggerstring									= Enter text of triggerstring. `n`nTip1: If you want to change capitalization in abbreviation, use no triggerstring options. `nE.g. ascii → ASCII. `n`nTip2: If you want exchange triggerstring of abbreviation into full phrase, `nend your triggerstring with "/" and `napply Immediate Execute (*) triggerstring option.
F_TI_OptionDisable										= Disables the hotstring. `n`nIf ticked, this option is shown in red color. `nBe aware that triggerstring tooltips (if enabled) `nare displayed even for disabled (triggerstring, hotstring) definitions.
TI_SHOF												= Select function, which will be used to show up hotstring. `n`nAvailable options: `n`nSendInput (SI): SendInput is generally the preferred method because of its superior speed and reliability. `nUnder most conditions, SendInput is nearly instantaneous, even when sending long strings. `nSince SendInput is so fast, it is also more reliable because there is less opportunity for some other window to pop up unexpectedly `nand intercept the keystrokes. Reliability is further improved by the fact `nthat anything the user types during a SendInput is postponed until afterward. `n`nClipboard (CL): hotstring is copied from clipboard. `nIn case of long hotstrings this is the fastest method. The downside of this method is delay `nrequired for operating system to paste content into specific window. `nIn order to change value of this delay see "Clipboard Delay (F7)" option in menu. `n`nMenu and SendInput (MSI): One triggerstring can be used to enter up to 7 hotstrings which are desplayed in form of list (menu). `nFor entering of chosen hotstring again SendInput (SI) is used. `n`nMenu & Clipboard (MCL): One triggerstring can be used to enter up to 7 hotstrings which are desplayed in form of list (menu). `nFor entering of chosen hotstring Clipboard (CL) is used. `n`nSenRaw (R): All subsequent characters, including the special characters ^+!#{}, `nto be interpreted literally rather than translating {Enter} to Enter, ^c to Ctrl+C, etc. `n`nSendPlay (SP): SendPlay's biggest advantage is its ability to "play back" keystrokes and mouse clicks in a broader variety of games `nthan the other modes. `nFor example, a particular game may accept hotstrings only when they have the SendPlay option. `n`nSendEvent (SE): SendEvent sends keystrokes using the same method as the pre-1.0.43 Send command.
TI_EnterHotstring										= Enter hotstring corresponding to the triggerstring. `n`nTip: You can use special key names in curved brackets. E.g.: {left 5} will move caret by 5x characters to the left.`n{Backspace 3} or {BS 3} will remove 3 characters from the end of triggerstring. `n`nTo send an extra space or tab after a replacement, include the space or tab at the end of the replacement `nbut make the last character an accent/backtick (`). `nFor example: `n:*:btw::By the way ``n`nBy default (that is, if SendRaw isn't used), the characters ^+!#{} have a special meaning. `nTo send those keys on its own, enclose the name in curly braces. `nFor example: {+}48 600 000.
TI_AddComment											= You can add optional (not mandatory) comment to new (triggerstring, hotstring) definition. `n`nThe comment can be max. 64 characters long. `n`nTip: Put here link to Wikipedia definition or any other external resource containing reference to entered definition.
TI_SelectHotstringLib									= Select .csv file containing (triggerstring, hotstring) definitions. `nBy default those files are located in C:\Users\<UserName>\Documents folder.
TI_LibraryContent										= After pressing (F2) you can move up or down in the table by pressing ↑ or ↓ arrows. `n`nEach time you select any row, options of the selected definitions are automatically loaded to the left part of this window.
TI_Sandbox											= Sandbox is used as editing field where you can test `nany (triggerstring, hotstring) definition, e.g. for testing purposes. `nThis area can be switched on/off and moves when you rescale `nthe main application window.
F_HK_CallGUIInfo										= Remark: this hotkey is operating system wide, so before changing it be sure it's not in conflict with any other system wide hotkey.`n`nIt opens Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Hotstrings, even if window is minimized or invisible.
F_HK_GeneralInfo										= You can enter any hotkey as combination of Shift, Ctrl, Alt modifier and any other keyboard key. `nIf you wish to have hotkey where Win modifier key is applied, use the checkbox separately.
F_HK_ClipCopyInfo										= Remark: this hotkey is operating system wide, so before changing it be sure it's not in conflict with any other system wide hotkey. `n`nWhen Hotstrings window exists (it could be minimized) pressing this hotkey copies content of clipboard to "Enter hotstring" field. `nThanks to that you can prepare new definition much quicker.
F_HK_UndoInfo											= Remark: this hotkey is operating system wide, so before changing it be sure it's not in conflict with any other system wide hotkey.`n`n When pressed, it undo the very last hotstring. Please note that result of undo depends on cursor position.
F_HK_TildeModInfo										= When the hotkey fires, its key's native function will not be blocked (hidden from the system).
F_HK_ToggleTtInfo										= Toggle visibility of all triggerstring tips. Advice: use ScrollLock or CapsLock for that purpose.
T_SBackgroundColorInfo									= Select from drop down list predefined color (one of 16 HTML colors) `nor select Custom one and then provide RGB value in HEX format (e.g. FF0000 for red). `nThe selected color will be displayed as background for on-screen menu.
T_STypefaceColor										= Select from drop down list predefined color (one of 16 HTML colors) `nor select Custom one and then provide RGB value in HEX format (e.g. FF0000 for red). `nThe selected color will be displayed as font color for on-screen menu.

T_STypefaceSize										= Select from drop down list predefined size of font. `nThe selected font size will be used in on screen menu.
T_StylPreview											= Press the "Test styling" button to get look & feel of selected styling settings below.
T_SoundEnable											= Sound can be emitted each time when event takes place. `nOne can specify sound frequency and duration.`n`nYou may slide the control by the following means: `n`n1) dragging the bar with the mouse; `n2) clicking inside the bar's track area with the mouse; `n3) turning the mouse wheel while the control has focus or `n4) pressing the following keys while the control has focus: ↑, →, ↓, ←, PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End. `n`nPgUp / PgDn step: 50 [ms]; `nInterval:         150 [ms]; `nRange:            50 ÷ 2 000 [ms]. `n`nTip: Recommended time is between 200 to 400 ms. `n`nPgUp / PgDn step: 50 [ms]; `nInterval:         150 [ms]; `nRange:            50 ÷ 2 000 [ms]. `n`nTip: Recommended time is between 200 to 400 ms.
T_TooltipEnable										= You can enable or disable the following tooltip: "Hotstring was triggered! [Shortcut] to undo." `nIf enabled, this tooltip is shown each time when even of displaying hotstring upon triggering it takes place. `nNext you can set accompanying features like timeout, position and even sound.
T_TooltipPosition										= Specify where tooltip should be displayed by default.`n`nWarning: some applications do not accept caret position. `n`nThen automatically cursor position is followed.
T_TooltipTimeout										= The infinite tooltip stays displayed on a screen till next event is triggered. `nIt's adviced to set finite tooltip. `n`nYou may slide the control by the following means: `n`n1) dragging the bar with the mouse; `n2) clicking inside the bar's track area with the mouse; `n3) turning the mouse wheel while the control has focus or `n4) pressing the following keys while the control has focus: ↑, →, ↓, ←, PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End. `n`nPgUp / PgDn step: 500 [ms]; `nInterval:         500 [ms]; `nRange:            1000 ÷ 10 000 [ms].
T_TriggerstringTips										= The triggerstring tips are displayed to help you recognize which triggerstrings are defined or available. `nThey are displayed in form of short list (tooltips).`n`nYou can define styling of triggerstring tips: Menu → Configuration.
T_TtSortingOrder										= The sorting order let you define how the triggerstring tips list positions are sorted out. `nThere are two options, which can be active on the same time: alphabetically or by length. `nYou can check out the differences by pressing the Tooltip test button.
T_TtMaxNoOfTips										= Maximum length of the triggerstring tips list. `n`nIf currently available list is longer, only the specified amount of triggerstring tips is displayed. `nPlease mind that displayed list could be just shorter.
T_TtNoOfChars											= It is possible to configure triggerstring tips to be displayed only if some first characters are already entered. `nE.g. if this parameter is set to 2, the first list appears if 2 or more characters of any existing triggerstring tip are entered.
T_ATT1												= If active triggerstring tips are enabled, then it is possible to use keyboard shortcuts `nto enter one of the triggerstrings from currently displayed list. `n`nActive triggerstring shortcuts: `n`nControl + Enter to enter any of the triggerstring tips `nControl + ↓ or Control + ↑ to move down or up on the list `n Control + Tab or Control + Shift + Tab to move down or up on the list.
T_TtComposition										= `n`nOf course if additional columns are chosen, window will become wider.
T_SMT2												= This option let's you to display permanent, "static" window `nwhere you can always find up-to-date "triggerstring tips" and "hotstring menus". `n`nOptions are combinations of other "events" options (set in other tabs).
